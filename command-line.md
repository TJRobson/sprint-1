Explaining Command Line:
Most people with be use to using the mouse/cursor to execute commands. Command line is like that but instead of clicking/right clicking/double clicking, you log a series of standard text based commands or prompts. There are commands to help navigate wihtin folders, find/create/copy/move and modify folders/files. I would say it is reminicent of MS-DOS, which is timely given my mum's age.
